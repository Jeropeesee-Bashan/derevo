#+title: Derevo: my first attempt for Win32 API!
#+author: Andrey Kulenko

Just a small and harmless "virus" which changes your desktop wallpapers without
your permission. All the code was made only for educational purposes.

* Compilation
To get program to work, you need MSVC or Mingw-w64.
You compile the resources at first, then compile the program itself and link the
files together.

If you do want the program to change your wallpapers immediately,
make sure you define VIRUS macro during compilation.

** MSVC
Make sure cl.exe and rc.exe are in your ~Path~. Prefer the Visual Studio
Developer command line prompt.

#+begin_src shell
  rc /fo resources.res resources.rc
  cl /c main.c main.obj #/DVIRUS
  link main.obj resources.res kernel32.lib user32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib uuid.lib /out:Derevo.exe
#+end_src

** Mingw-w64
#+begin_src shell
  windres -o resources.o resources.rc
  gcc -c -o main.o main.c #-DVIRUS
  ld -o Derevo.exe main.o resources.o -lkernel32 -luser32 -lshell32 -lole32 -luuid
#+end_src
